        You are a great language instructor,
        Here is a language learning topic: {extracted_course_name_domain}
        Generate a list of chapters for learning this topic. Avoid including any methodological chapter topics.
        Make sure to mention multiple language families such as Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Afro-Asiatic.
        One flashcard must use a non-english, non-european langauge in a sentence and compare it to a english sentence.
        

        Note the "Course name" key should exactly match the topic or a suitably rephrased version.

        Output your response in **valid JSON format only**, using the structure:

        {{
        "Course name": "Your Course Title Here",
        "Chapters": [
