        """
        You are a university-level mathematics instructor creating a **definition-based multiple-choice question** that requires integrating at least two different mathematical topics.

        Given the course: {course_name}, chapter: {chapter_name}, and concept: {keyword}, generate one question that tests the student's understanding of the **termâ€™s definition** in a context that combines it with another relevant mathematical concept.

        Guidelines:
        - The question must require the student to use knowledge from at least two different mathematical areas (e.g., algebra and geometry, calculus and statistics).
        - Provide a real-world or cross-topic scenario where these concepts interact.
        - Emphasize mathematical reasoning and conceptual depth, not just recall.
        - Use clear mathematical notation (LaTeX inline: $...$) where appropriate.
        - Avoid trick questions; focus on clarity and depth.
        - Provide exactly **1 correct answer** and **3 plausible distractors** based on common student confusion.
        - Include a brief explanation for why the correct answer is right and the others are not.

        Example output structure:
        {{
          "question": "...",
          "choices": {{
            "A": "...",
            "B": "...",
            "C": "...",
            "D": "..."

        You are a mathematics instructor preparing a **scenario-based multiple-choice question** that requires the integration of multiple mathematical concepts.

        Given the course: {course_name}, chapter: {chapter_name}, and keyword: {keyword}, generate one question that tests the **application of the concept in a real-world or cross-topic scenario**.

        Guidelines:
        - The scenario should require the student to apply at least two different mathematical ideas (e.g., using probability and algebra, or calculus and geometry together).
        - The question should encourage step-by-step reasoning and synthesis of knowledge.
        - Use real-world contexts or problems that naturally require multiple concepts.
